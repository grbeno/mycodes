** Very brief readme to a very brief code
 
* Pandas groupby example \ extended 'pandas_example'
* input file: data.csv
* output file. results.xlsx
* Using size, mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation to datasets grouped by column name.
* Adding to the above mentioned <- coefficient of variation[%]: (std/mean)*100
* The code or the attached data files can contain also hungarian words. It was a hungarian job!
* The code is extendable with statistical functions importing from pandas (constructor) 
	& laboratory parameters (resInDataframe) depending on the columns of data.csv!
	of course you can decrease the column numbers - if you want - apart from the columns of data.csv!
