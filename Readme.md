## Hello everyone!
My name is Benedek GrÃ¡czol and this repo is not really a real world project to run almost immediately on your computer, this would be my portfolio instead, collection of my codes or something like this. ðŸ˜Š

#### The goal why I created this repo:
To present some details about coding issues and mini projects in which I participated.
  
#### The reason why I created this repo:
I have mentioned things about programming in my resume and on my linkedin page, so I am thinking now, it would be correct if i push some of my codes to GitHub.

#### Why these codes?
These codes are a kind of selection and I have selected them because they were very useful when I faced to coding issues. 
(The algorithms, list comprehension, mapping, pandas, sql queries (sorry if I left out someone!) helped me in the hard times).

#### How is the future of this repo looks like?
According to my plans I am going to regularly update the repo with new codes, projects or something relevant stuffs.
I am working on a django project nowadays. I hope this will be a professional web application and helps for experts in agricultural field. 
To this I am going to push also related code snippets or mini projects soon.

#### What else have I got?
I wrote VBA and C codes earlier, but as you will notice I have not added these to repo. Honestly, I have not dealt with these programming languages for a while. On my wordpress site you can find VBA and C codes as well and the django project (under Python section) mentioned above. You can check it on this link: https://graczolbenedek.com/wp/ 
  
Thank you for reading my readme! ðŸ˜Š
