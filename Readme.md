## Hello everyone!
My name is Benedek GrÃ¡czol and this repo is not really a real-world project to run almost immediately on your computer, this would be a collection of my codes or something like this. ðŸ˜Š
This repo is basically referring to the content of my website https://graczolbenedek.com/wp/.

### The goal(s) why I created this repo:
***(1)*** It's always good if we can help for someone, so I will try to boost this repo.<br/>
***(2)*** To help my future self if I forget something solved before.
  
### The reason why I created this repo:
I have mentioned things about programming in my resume and on my linkedin page, so now I think, it would be correct if I push some of my codes to GitHub. Moreover the most part of my website is written in Hungarian, so here is some English descriptions as well.

### What are these codes?
These codes are a kind of selection and I have selected them because they were very useful when I faced to coding issues.
These codes are snippets, some of them are part of code modules or one of my program. The algorithms, list comprehension, mapping, pandas, sql queries (sorry if I left out someone!) helped me a lot.

### What else have I got?
I wrote VBA and C codes earlier, but as you will notice I have not added these to repo. Honestly, I have not dealt with these programming languages for a while. On my Wordpress site you can find VBA and C codes as well and a section about Django framework and web development. 

By the way I am working on this and related projects now: http://mysite-grbeno.herokuapp.com/

Thank you for reading my readme! ðŸ˜Š
